# Hangman Game ðŸŽ®

This is a simple command-line Hangman game built using Python. In this game, players try to guess a randomly selected word by suggesting letters within a limited number of guesses. Each incorrect guess results in drawing a part of the hangman figure, and the game is lost when the figure is fully drawn.

## Features
- **Word Guessing**: Random word selection from a predefined list.
- **Limited Attempts**: Players have a fixed number of incorrect guesses before losing the game.
- **Progress Display**: The current state of the word and incorrect guesses are shown after each attempt.
- **End Conditions**: Players win if they guess the word correctly; they lose if they exceed the maximum number of incorrect guesses.
- **Simple and Fun**: Easy to understand and play, with a focus on classic hangman gameplay.

## How to Play
1. The game randomly selects a word from a predefined list.
2. You have a limited number of guesses to figure out the word by guessing one letter at a time.
3. If the letter exists in the word, it will be revealed in its correct position(s).
4. If the letter is incorrect, part of the hangman figure is drawn.
5. The game ends when you either:
Â Â Â - Guess the word correctly and win, or
Â Â Â - Make too many incorrect guesses and lose.
